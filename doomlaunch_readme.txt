This is super specific to my setup and how I run WAD Wednesday, but some of the code may be illuminating as to how to do certain things with Playscii.

1. Extract the playscii_doomlaunch folder here into your Documents/Playscii/games/ folder
2. launch Playscii
3. enter Game Mode
4. open the "doomlaunch" game

If it doesn't work as intended, check out the path names defined at the top of scripts/doomlaunch.py and make sure they match the needed paths on your system. This assumes you have a local mirror of the idgames archive, which can be obtained relatively easily from the command line with a recursive wget.
